                Although the universe itself isn't a conscious entity, it possesses the raw materials that, when
                properly set into motion, create consciousness. It has the ability to create intelligent life, which is
                capable of understanding the universe ... It can know itself indirectly

            The increase in the level of living standards of individuals has a direct correspondence with the development of new materials with improved properties. Replacing conventional materials with the most advanced materials is vital for the efficient usage of resources. Consequently, it is essential to have profound knowledge and understanding of the selection of the materials by studying their microstructure, composition, properties, and processing techniques and developing new materials for an extensive range of applications.

            I am a Materials Science Engineer, incited by nature and its components like the living creatures, vegetative environment, flora-fauna, and numerous matters which shape our everyday life. My interest in materials science and living nature has inspired me to pursue research in biomimicry materials, which emulates the models and components of nature to solve real-world problems. Biomimetic materials designing, through a multidisciplinary approach, possess tremendous potential to shape future technology, making it more sustainable and renewable. This is my motivation to study and further improve my knowledge and understanding of the materials which shape our lives daily.
